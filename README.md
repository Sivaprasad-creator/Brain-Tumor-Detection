## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds an **automatic Brain Tumor Detection system** using **MRI scan images**. It classifies scans into **three tumor types** — **Pituitary, Meningioma, Glioma** — and also detects if **no tumor** is present. The solution uses **Deep Learning (CNN & Transfer Learning)** and is deployed as a **Streamlit web app** for user-friendly predictions.

> 🔧 **Tools Used:** Python, Deep Learning (CNN, VGG16), Streamlit

## 📁 Dataset Information

- **Source:** Public dataset from Kaggle  
- **Data Type:** JPG MRI scan images  
- **Classes:** Pituitary, Meningioma, Glioma, No Tumor  
- **Key Features:** High-resolution MRI images, organized in labeled folders for training and testing

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict whether an MRI image shows a brain tumor or not  
- Classify the type of tumor if detected  
- Visualize sample images and predictions  
- Deploy as a simple web application for real-time use

---

## 📊 Analysis Summary

- **Data Augmentation:** Random rotations, zoom, flips, and shifts applied for robust training  
- **Class Balance:** Checked distributions to handle any imbalance  
- **Visualization:** Displayed sample images from each category for verification  
- **Performance:** Evaluated models with confusion matrix and accuracy/loss curves
